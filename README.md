### Estimated Time to Complete

60 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

Begin getting comfortable with for loops and while loops

---

### Assignment Overview

Follow the instructions in both `week_days.py` to complete this challenge. 

REMEMBER: Comment out or delete the calls to your functions -- the tests can't run with them!

## Summary

0. Accept the challenge via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in `restaurant_data.py`
3. From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to see if your code works as expected
4. Perform you commands for `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code 
5. Access your GitHub Repository: Go to the GitHub website and log in to your account.
6. Navigate to the repository for this exercise.
7. Watch for the Red X (or yellow dot as the test runs) to change to the green check mark.  The green check mark on a GitHub repository indicates that the commit or pull request have been tested and meet the defined criteria for correctness.
8.  If there's a red "X" instead, it means the tests have failed.  You'll need to investigate and fix the issues in VScode the git add, git commit, git pull again.
9. The status in Canvas does not change to Complete until an Instructor has reviewed your assignment.  This process is similar to the Code review process in a real work scenario.  A code review by an instructor or a senior developer after unit tests pass is an important step in the software development process. It helps ensure that the code not only functions correctly but also adheres to best practices, coding standards, and maintainability guidelines.


You are all set!
